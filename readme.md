Web-c, Web-v
============

This is an experimental self-chat program, designed for moving small data between machines via WebRTC.  It's designed with experimental decentralization measures to move SDP data without a public signaling channel.  You can manually copy and paste compressed SDPs or use Dropbox as a psuedo-signaling server.

Unfortunately due to timeout restrictions you'll only have roughly 30 seconds or so to make the connection.
